                <p>I am a Second year Computer science (with placement year) bachelorâ€™s undergraduate degree student at the University of Sussex. 
                  <br>I'm currently working part-time as an IT assistant with finical responsibilities in the IT department at the University Of Sussex student union. I have a lot of responsibilities such as solving different troubleshooting and resolving all kinds of problems, errors, or faults within software or student's computer systems, also maintaining servers. 

                  <br>During my summer vacations I have trained and was part of the team responsible of technical support for a variety of equipment and banking technology systems, e.g., Diebold Nixdorf ATMs, DataCard ID and Financial solutions, Cheque clearing and sorting system and various other banking solutions 
                  
                  <br>In my free time I have decided to venture into a side business providing services to fix and repair electronic devices both hardware and/or remote software fixes.  
                  
                  <br>My expertise extends further preforming as a DJ creating and remixing songs and publishing them online. Moreover, I love photography and videography in which I make short travel videos on Instagram.

          <h2>HomeAutomation</h2>
          <p>I always wanted to automate my room, but everything was too expensive, however with the use of the Raspberry Pi and ESP, I turned my Pi into a server and the ESP communicated with the Pi, where I used relays and servo motors to control the lights and different home appliances. After setting the ESP up I used Adafruit cloud server, to control all the PINs on the ESP. Doing all of this gives me the ability to send commands using my Google Assistant, through IFTTT which is an online digital automation service. Which can connect with Adafruit cloud server to execute the command on the ESP. </p>

          <p>After learning Java in the first year of Computer Science I wanted to 
            make an application that lets you keep count of how many drinks did you have and share them with your friends. As well as it makes sure that your friends leave drunk. And most importantly 
            you can be partying with your friends from different locations!!</p>

          <p>When I finished my first year of computer science, I decided to build a portfolio website, and it turned out to be one of the best experiences ever, I learned new programming languages and further developed my knowledge about raspberry pi servers into google cloud servers. My website is live on the web with the domain name www.ramzidaher.com </p>

          <p>MagicMirror is an open-source software that allows you to turn a display device, such as a TV or monitor, into a smart mirror. It can display a variety of information, such as the current time and date, weather forecast, news headlines, and more. MagicMirror is built using JavaScript. It is customizable, so you can add or remove features and change the layout and appearance of the mirror to suit your preferences.  </p>
